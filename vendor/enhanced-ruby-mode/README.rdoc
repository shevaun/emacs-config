== Description

Enhanced Ruby Mode replaces the emacs ruby mode that comes with ruby.

It uses the Ripper class found in ruby 1.9.2 to parse and indent the source code.  As a consquence only ruby 1.9.2
syntax is parsed correctly.

== TODO

Optimisation. Parses and fontifies whole buffer each modification - still runs fast enough on large files.
Replace need for flymake.
Suggestions?


== Synopsis

   (add-to-list 'load-path "(path-to)/Enhanced-Ruby-Mode") ; must be added after any path containing old ruby-mode
   (setq enh-ruby-program "(path-to-ruby1.9.2)/bin/ruby") ; so that still works if ruby points to ruby1.8
   (require 'ruby-mode)
