* Optimise parsing
- use array instead of string: can use gets to parse more lines, can store meta info from last parse
- parse minimal subsection: most chars don't alter much except "'%({[` <<END \n
- calc lineno in emacs from last known lineno if pos is closer than point-min (steal line-number-at-pos code)
